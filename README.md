  The application I developed is an inventory tracking system to help the user better organize and increase productivity. The requirements for the application are that it needs to have a login or register screen, a table that displays the items in the inventory from the data in the database, the ability to add item and change their quantity. The application also has a dark theme and the capability to send SMS messages. The layout of the pages in this application are streamlined to support the users need to increase productivity. When planning to code the application I luckily had just built a CRUD database using SQLite in my other class this semester and used the lessons I learned to build the code for this project. I think these lessons in creating and using CRUD databases will be beneficial in the future. Although I have been told in most courses I have taken to test often I failed to do it while writing the code for this project and ended up scrambling to try and debug at the end. I found that from my initial plan to my final product i needed to simplify my design to meet my knowledge and ability level.
